This fast adoption of nuclear power would prove to be a clumsy and an uncalculated move when recently built nuclear power plants in the Midwest and East Coast would melt down. Nearly a million people would be exposed to radiation within the affected areas, causing many ill-effects. Biotegris, a pharmaceutical company approaches the United States government for subsidies to fund a new anti-radiation drug named Dioxiodine, which can be administered by injection or orally. FDA director Brian Moore, with Biotegris in his pockets, gets the new drug approved hastily with no clinical trials conducted to prove its safety and effectiveness. FEMA director Edward J Almos would order millions of doses of Dioxiodine to be sent to clinics and hospitals in affected areas. Weeks after waves of doses, people began exhibiting behaviors of extreme violence, aggression, and hostility to people who have not received doses of Dioxiodine. The Emergency Alert System would be broadcasted across the country, with marshal law and lawlessness ensuing as law enforcement and the military are overwhelmed by mass riots, chaos, and the 'people' exhibiting extreme violence, aggression, and hostility as a result of taking Dioxiodine.",

This vehicle experiences a shortage of gas and other mechanical problems as soon as the bus you're on enters the abandoned city of Holston, Pennsylvania. a city that is one of many others is on the route your driver is taking; the place itself was abandoned a week and a half ago; those previously stated problems finally bring the transport to a grinding halt; the driver, alongside whatever national guardsmen are present, reassures you that the vehicle will continue moving as soon as these problems are taken care of. All four men leave the bus. The driver opens the hood and inspects the engine for any damages before moving to siphon gas from any surrounding vehicles left behind during the panic. The guardsmen search the area for any threats, expecting nothing as the city has been quiet ever since they entered the city. An hour later, you all hear gunshots, followed by screaming and panic. You see nothing through the windows, though. You all stay inside the bus, afraid to move or go outside. Finally, one figure is seen running towards the bus, waving his hands in the air and shouting for you all to start the bus. As he is leapt upon by a group of people, if you could even call them that anymore, they claw into him, biting or even using blunt or sharp objects to kill the man as he attempts to plea for help. Using his death as a distraction, you all scatter, running out of the bus, splitting off into groups, or going alone into the cities more rural areas, this whole city is placed under a heavy exclusion zone, just by being here without any sort of government or military personnel with you is a death warrant.",
